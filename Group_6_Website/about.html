        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This is a project is made to spread awareness on the different polling places in 
          PG County </p>
        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>To use this dynamic web application the user needs to type in the polling address of interest
          into the search bar and then click on the 'Catalog' button to generate a list of the different 
          polling places around that location. Then if the user clicks the 'Plot' button, the map itself
          would be populated to with location icons that indicate the different polling locations near
          the address the user entered.</p>
        <h3>Problem We Aim To Solve</h3>
        <p>In PG County voter turnout among young people is very low as many young people choose
          not to vote. Voting is very important and by encouraging young people to vote then significant
          changes can be made in the political landscape. To solve this problem we created a web
          application that provides a map visualization, making it easier for individuals 
          to find the nearest polling places around their location.
          </p>
        <h3>Data We Used</h3>
        <p>
          Our data came from an API that showcases the different polling locations throughout PG County
          which were found through Prince Georgeâ€™s County Open Data API:
