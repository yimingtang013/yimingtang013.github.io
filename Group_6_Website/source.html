        <p>
          This project was done by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JS libraries I used 
          was Leaflet.JS in order to have user interaction with the map. Express was used to
          process data from the PG County API and then pass it to the front end where it is read 
          as a JSON object and then the data is loaded onto the page. The back end is made up of
          primarily JavaScript and runs in Node.JS. There are 3 API calls and the GET is created
          for returning the different polling locations. PUT is created for returning the polling
          locations that match conditions of the user. JSON objects are then parsed frontend to 
          produce the list and map seen.
